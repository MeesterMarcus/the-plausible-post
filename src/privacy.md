This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

Information we collect
We only collect basic analytics data to understand site usage. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics collects information such as pages visited, referral source, device and browser information, and anonymized IP addresses.

Cookies and similar technologies
We may use cookies set by third parties (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect analytics information. Cookies are small data files stored on your device; you can disable them in your browser settings, though some site features may be affected.

How we use information
The data we collect is used only to improve the site, measure traffic, and generate aggregated, anonymized usage reports. We do not sell or share personal data for advertising or other commercial purposes.

Third-party services
We use Google Analytics (and its associated services). Their use of cookies and collection of data is subject to Google's privacy policies.

Children’s privacy
Our site is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Data security
We take reasonable measures to protect the data we collect, but no system is completely secure. If you have concerns about your data, contact us (see below).

Changes to this policy
We may update this policy occasionally; the date at the top will reflect the most recent revision.
