In an effort to promote civic responsibility and reduce the clutter piling up in homes, the suburban township of Glenwood announced Tuesday that it will begin offering curbside collection of unused excuses, becoming the first municipality in the nation to formalize such a service.  

Officials say the program is intended to help residents safely discard excuses they no longer rely on, such as “traffic was bad,” “I didn’t get the email,” and the increasingly outdated “my printer wasn’t working.” The excuses, once collected, will be consolidated at a centralized processing facility where they can be recycled into new justifications more suitable for modern usage.  

“Much like glass, paper, or plastics, excuses can be sustainably repurposed,” said Town Sanitation Director Martin Hurst, standing in front of a demonstration bin filled with discarded phrases like *‘I thought it was tomorrow’* and *‘My cousin’s wedding ran long.’* “We simply saw too many excuses ending up in landfills—or worse, in household conversations where they don’t biodegrade properly. Our team believes Glenwood can set a model nationwide.”  

Residents will receive color-coded bins for sorting: a blue bin for personal excuses (e.g., “I was tired”), a green bin for workplace excuses (“computer crashed unexpectedly”), and an orange bin for generic life-event excuses, such as “family emergency,” which Glenwood officials say are especially easy to reconstitute into stronger, more durable cover stories.  

Local response has been mixed. “It’s about time the government did something about all these old excuses cluttering up the garage,” said longtime resident Heather Sloane, who admitted to holding on to nearly two decades’ worth of unconvincing reasons for being late to Pilates. “I found an unopened box of *‘flat tire’* I bought back in 2009. I’ll never use them now—it feels good to let go.”  

Others were less enthusiastic. “Excuses are personal, and I don’t like the idea of strangers rifling through mine,” complained Glenwood-based insurance adjuster Brad Meyer, who said the township confiscated a bundle of “didn’t hear my alarm go off” statements he intended to keep in an attic trunk for his children. “They’re heirlooms.”  

The township insists privacy concerns are unwarranted, noting that any compelling excuse will be shredded into “ambiguous circumstances” before being recast into more universally serviceable lines such as “something came up” or “honestly, you’re not going to believe this.”  

Early data from pilot neighborhoods suggest 62% of excuses collected so far fall under the category of “just didn’t feel like it,” while another 18% consist of “stuck in traffic” despite Glenwood’s traffic-free grid of cul-de-sacs. Officials say incidences of residents sneaking in fresh lies disguised as recyclable excuses are rare, though volunteers have been trained to identify suspiciously pristine “feeling under the weather” tags that show no wear.  

To incentivize compliance, the township is offering tax credits for households that place full bins on the curb at least twice a month. Officials claim some residents have already embraced the policy as a status symbol, with decorative outdoor racks displaying their surplus of broken-down apologies.  

Glenwood Mayor Denise Worthington urged residents to think about the community impact. “We all make excuses,” Worthington said at a press briefing. “The question is whether we keep letting them pile up in the basement—or come together as neighbors to give them a responsible second life. This isn’t just about waste. It’s about accountability.”  

The program is expected to expand regionally by the end of the year, provided the county can secure adequate storage for the overwhelming backlog of “dog ate my homework” excuses still pouring in from area middle schools.
