In a unanimous but hurried session on Friday, the City Council voted to "study" the increasingly popular two-day work week, citing constituent confusion and a dramatic drop in municipal email volume.

"We need to gather more data," said Councilmember Avery, who sponsored the motion. "Do people working two days still expect potholes fixed on the third? We must proceed with caution."

Analysts predict the review will include a subcommittee, a public forum, and at least one infographic. No immediate changes to schedules were announced.
