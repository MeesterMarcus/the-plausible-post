A seed-stage startup announced Monday that it has raised a $12M round to build "Aspiration-as-a-Service," a subscription platform that delivers curated motivational emails and faux promotion roadmaps so subscribers can feel like they're climbing a career ladder without actually changing their calendar.

"People want momentum without the messy parts — like work," said the founder, who prefers to be described as a 'progress engineer.' The service includes weekly affirmation templates, a quarterly badge system, and an optional Slack bot that reacts positively to any message containing the word 'pivot.'
