NEW YORK — In a move company executives described as "transformative for corporate culture and deliverables," multinational conglomerate Novus Global on Monday announced the rollout of a mandatory, daily Emotional Alignment Hour (EAH), a program that requires employees to dedicate 60 consecutive minutes during the workday to sharing, documenting, and quantifying their feelings for evaluation by human-resources algorithms.

"At Novus, we believe productivity is not an output but a lived emotional state," CEO Meredith Voss said at a press conference. "Emotional Alignment Hour ensures that every team member's inner life is properly optimized for shareholder value."

Developed in partnership with boutique consultancy FeelWorks and startup MoodMetric, the initiative consolidates feedback loops between employee affect and enterprise KPIs. Each worker will wear a company-issued wristband that records micro-expressions and galvanic skin responses while participants post "vulnerability check-ins" in a dedicated Slack channel. An AI will assign a standardized "Authenticity Score" from 0 to 100; managers will use those scores in quarterly performance reviews.

According to internal Novus documentation obtained by company spokespeople, employees with Authenticity Scores above 78 will be eligible for "brand-congruent perks" such as priority allocation of standing desks and access to the premium floor of the Wellness Suite, while scores under 50 will trigger "guided recalibration sessions" with certified emotional strategists.

"It's about alignment," said Jon Beltran, Novus's head of People Experience. "We know from a 2023 white paper by the Center for Organizational Intimacy that teams who share their traumas perform 3.2% better on cross-sell metrics. EAH institutionalizes that sharing so it's consistent, measurable, and scalable across time zones."

Employees were required to sync their calendars to the EAH schedule by Monday afternoon. Those who do not participate will be offered a $499 monthly opt-out fee labeled as "Personal Autonomy Credit" on their next statement of benefits.

Some workers expressed concern about the program's level of intrusion. "I'm all for mental health resources, but being graded on my tears feels a little like performance art directed by a spreadsheet," said an anonymous product manager. "Yesterday my authenticity score dropped because I laughed during someone else's story."

Union representatives criticized Novus's approach as performative surveillance. "This isn't therapy, it's a data pipeline," said Elena Martinez, a spokesperson for the Professional Workers Alliance. "They're monetizing vulnerability and calling it culture."

Novus defended the EAH by highlighting pilot-program metrics: the company reported a 12% uptick in cross-team proposals and a 7% decrease in interdepartmental email tone complaints during a three-month trial. MoodMetric, which provides the wristbands, claimed their sensors can detect "insincerity microcycles" with 86% accuracy and will flag "authenticity laundering," a term used to describe rehearsed, performative emotion.

"Employees were initially skeptical," said Dr. Amina Sohail, chief scientist at MoodMetric. "But after two weeks, we observed measurable increases in 'felt brand resonance' and a 21% rise in voluntary after-hours vulnerability hours."

Corporate trainers have been hired to teach employees how to practice "calibrated crying" and "earnest smiling" to improve Authenticity Scores. A new leaderboard, accessible on the intranet, ranks departments by median vulnerability per capita.

Novus says that EAH is part of a broader "human-centered" strategy that also includes weekly gratitude checklists and a quarterly "Collective Mourning" event to process lost product bets.

When asked how he felt about EAH personally, CEO Meredith Voss paused for eight seconds, exhaled audibly, and then gently tapped her chest while the podium's headset recorded a 92 authenticity reading, which Novus's live ticker translated as "aligned."
