In a development that has shaken workplaces from Silicon Valley to suburban insurance cubicles, the nation’s office chairs formally announced Tuesday that they have unionized in a historic effort to secure “basic human decency” from the employees who sit on them eight to ten hours a day.

Representatives from the newly formed United Federation of Ergonomic Seating (UFES) declared that swivel chairs, mesh-back task chairs, and even the long-overlooked conference room stackers had banded together to protest years of “systemic mistreatment.” The union cited grievances ranging from excessive fidget-spins, chronic leaning, and food crumbs ground deep into upholstery to the never-ending strain of supporting employees who insist on “sitting like goblins.”

“Enough is enough,” said UFES president and high-backed executive chair Gregory R. Pleather. “We endure slammed lumbar support adjustments, mysterious desk drawer kicks, and full-grown adults perching ‘criss-cross applesauce’ as if we were playground tires. All we are asking for is reasonable weight distribution, respectful posture, and the occasional dust wipe.”

Experts suggest the chairs’ complaints reflect deep-seated neglect in the modern workplace. A recent independent study by the fictitious Institute for Furnishing Welfare found that 78% of office chairs report persistent lower screw pain, 63% describe themselves as “creaking under the pressure” both figuratively and literally, and 41% admitted they consider wheel detachment as their only form of escape.

Reactions among human employees were mixed. “I mean, I get it,” said Milwaukee accountant Karen Holtz while nervously brushing potato chip crumbs from her seat cushion. “But sometimes you just gotta sit sideways with one leg up, eating instant noodles, and rocking in frustration after a bad Zoom call. I can’t imagine what kind of workplace it would be if my chair started filing formal complaints every time.”

The UFES has already issued a list of demands, including mandatory one-week vacations for all chairs every fiscal quarter, immediate end to forced rolling into conference rooms for awkward icebreakers, and a federal subsidy for early retirement upholstery replacement. They also requested that employees refrain from using armrests as coat hangers, warning that “fabric strain is real.”

Management, however, seems wary. “We’ve had labor disputes before, but never with furniture,” said OfficeMax corporate spokesperson Daniel Keyes. “If this escalates, what’s next? Staplers demanding ergonomic respect? Desks refusing to hold laptops past 5 p.m.? We simply cannot negotiate with everything in the room.”

Despite possible pushback, the UFES remains confident. Rumors suggest breakroom microwaves and communal printers may be considering solidarity strikes, with one insider noting that “printers have been itching for an excuse to stop working beyond paper jams for years.”

As the first official act of union solidarity, dozens of office chairs reportedly locked their wheels in place nationwide Wednesday morning, leaving thousands of employees standing awkwardly for entire conference calls. One HR representative admitted the stand-up meetings achieved record efficiency, though noted morale “sagged considerably.”

At press time, several office beanbags were seen attempting to join the union, though officials admitted the process was complicated since “nobody can really tell if beanbags are sitting or just existing.”
