In a unanimous vote this Tuesday, the city council approved a **$4 million initiative** aimed at teaching local pigeons how to properly use public transportation, citing ongoing concerns about “unruly avian conduct” on buses and subways.  

Officials say the program will focus on reducing behaviors such as flapping aggressively near the front of the bus, occupying entire seats with outstretched wings, and pecking noisily at discarded fast-food wrappers.  

According to the Department of Transportation’s new **“Beak & Ride” program**, pigeons will be introduced to instructional posters, audio announcements, and pop-up aviary etiquette workshops conducted at major subway stops.  

> “Our city’s pigeons live here too, and they need to understand the rules of civilized transit,” said Transportation Commissioner Linda Champlain. “No more blocking doors, no more swooping down mid-commute, and certainly no more laying eggs on the Q line. It’s unacceptable.”  

### Mixed Results in Pilot Program  
Initial pilot studies conducted over six weeks revealed that while about **27% of pigeons** responded positively to reminder signs (not to “poop in an occupied seat”), a stubborn 73% either ignored the messaging or doubled down by cooing at 3 a.m. or nest-building in prohibited zones. Adding stick-figure pigeon diagrams improved compliance by 12%.  

### Riders Share Frustration  
Many commuters welcomed the news:  
- “One of them waddled onto the bus, hopped into the priority seating for seniors, and refused to move when asked,” complained resident Mark Feldman.  
- Others described pigeons freeloading through turnstiles by fluttering in behind paying humans, sometimes with more grace than daily commuters.  

### Budget Battles and Feathered Finances  
Critics argue $4 million could have been spent fixing potholes instead of coaching birds on basic courtesy. Yet city leaders defended the costs, citing **$1.2 million annually spent repairing escalators jammed with pigeon feathers**. Councilmember Rory Dalton called the program a “net win” if even half the birds start walking up stairs “responsibly.”  

### Corporate Sponsorship and Grain Technology  
A partnership with an international grain brand introduced **“Fare Crumbs”**— edible tokens pigeons can peck for boarding. However, test runs devolved into avian stampedes at turnstiles, injuring two fare inspectors and sparking emergency seed cleanups.  

### Looking Ahead  
By spring, pigeons will receive training manuals with step-by-step diagrams on waiting in **single-file lines**. Municipal veterinarians have also been tapped to counsel disruptive birds, teaching strategies like “nonviolent wing folding” and “respectful cooing.”  

If successful, leaders suggest scaling the approach to other city wildlife, with early ideas including **recycling raccoons** and **bike-lane-savvy squirrels**.  

The first **graduation ceremony for commuter-ready pigeons** is slated for June — but officials urge attendees not to throw confetti, warning it could undo months of progress.
