**WASHINGTON**—In an unprecedented move to curb employee burnout, companies across the country have begun implementing “silent screaming breaks,” a wellness initiative that allows workers to release pent-up existential despair into a soundproof pod for exactly four minutes each afternoon.  

According to the American Office Health Association (AOHA), the program is already being hailed as a “game-changing innovation in pretending to care about mental health.” Employers claim workers emerge from the booths refreshed, re-centered, and only slightly more aware of how terrifying their lives have become.  

“We’ve provided gyms, snacks, and mindfulness apps, but there’s no substitute for a good blood-curdling shriek into a padded cube while whispering the names of your least competent managers,” said Nancy Hill, wellness coordinator for a mid-sized insurance firm in Ohio. “The silence aspect is crucial. Screaming audibly in the office still violates HR policy.”  

The booths, marketed under the name *ScreamSpace™*, retail for $3,799 each and feature triple-layer acoustic insulation, dimmable lighting, and a small mirror to allow employees to lock eyes with their own reflection while reevaluating every decision they’ve ever made. Early adopters say the pods also double as convenient nap stations, panic rooms, or spaces for crying so intensely that coworkers assume you’ve simply been out to lunch.  

A recent AOHA study found that productivity increased by 12% in offices with screaming pods, though researchers admitted the figure was difficult to measure precisely given that no one volunteered to check the booths for occupants once a day. “We just assumed they’d come out eventually,” explained lead researcher Martin Duval. “In one office, we found a data analyst had been inside a ScreamSpace for three consecutive days. He claimed he was ‘the most productive he had ever felt.’”  

Not everyone is convinced. Libertarian think tanks have denounced the initiative as another encroachment of “Big Wellness” into private life. “If screaming is mandated at work, what’s next?” asked policy analyst Trent Mallory. “Compulsory sobbing before payroll deductions? State-sponsored primal yawning? Where does it end?”  

Employees, however, seem to overwhelmingly approve of the program. “Before, I used to have to go out to my car, grip the steering wheel, and scream into my jacket like a feral raccoon,” said Megan Ramirez, a marketing associate in Denver. “Now, I can stay right at my desk until it’s my turn to enter the pod, stare dead into the abyss, and let out a silent holler so intense my Apple Watch thinks I’ve died.”  

The federal government has also taken notice. The Department of Labor is reportedly piloting a “National Quiet Wailing Hour” across select agencies, during which employees may release anguish into environmentally friendly foam cubes provided at each workstation. Congress is considering a tax break for companies that purchase multiple ScreamSpaces, though legislators remain divided on whether spouses should be allowed to claim “joint screaming credits” at home.  

Despite some concerns about hygiene—two interns were recently treated for “scream-related pinkeye” after consecutive sessions in a poorly ventilated pod—the rollout continues nationwide. Industry analysts predict by 2025 virtually every major office will feature at least one silent screaming booth, alongside mandatory standing desks and the inexplicable birthday cupcake room.  

Reached for comment about the long-term goals of the project, an AOHA spokesperson stated calmly, “We predict collective silent screaming will soon become not just a workplace perk, but a foundational part of American culture—right alongside casual Fridays and pretending to enjoy team-building exercises.”  

At press time, dozens of employees were observed patiently waiting in line for the company’s single pod, each mouthing inaudible howls while scrolling Slack to see if their manager had “just tagged them in something stupid again.”
