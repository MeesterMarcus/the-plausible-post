BOSTON—In an effort to redefine the concept of a coffee break, Dunkin’ has introduced an “Ambient Coffee™” subscription that lets customers inhale unlimited amounts of fresh-brewed aroma without ever needing to drink a sip.  

“For just $9.99 a month, subscribers can walk into participating locations and simply breathe in the atmosphere of productivity,” said company spokesperson Marlene DeVito, noting that many Americans enjoy the smell of coffee more than the actual beverage, which can be “jitter-inducing” and, inconveniently, “too wet.”  

The initiative centers around special “scent domes,” Plexiglas booths retrofitted from COVID-testing kiosks, designed to immerse visitors in authentic coffee steam. Dunkin’ emphasized the domes replicate everything customers enjoy about coffee—minus stained teeth, spilled cups, or awkward small talk.  

“Experience is the new product,” explained retail analyst Curtis Blagg. “This is effectively the SoulCycle of hot beverages—except you don’t drink or ride, you just exist in the presence of roasted vapors.”  

Many adopters praised the convenience. Providence resident Jenine Ramos said the subscription lets her maintain her office persona as a dedicated “coffee person,” while never ingesting caffeine. “I take a five-minute dome session, come back smelling like hazelnut, and nobody has to know I was just standing next to a stranger crying in the dark,” she said.  

Not all feedback has been positive. Medical professionals warned against prolonged exposure to “macchiato condensate,” citing possible dizziness and nasal staining. Dunkin’, however, assured customers the domes were sanitized daily with a proprietary caramel mist and were “FDA-adjacent compliant.”  

Competitors are scrambling to adapt. Starbucks is piloting a “Cold Foam Whisper” program where customers pay $14.99 to listen to distant frothing sounds, while Panera is developing “Menu Candles” with scents like “Broccoli Cheddar in Sourdough Bowl.”  

Dunkin’ executives remain bullish. “Holding liquids is outdated,” said DeVito. “Smelling is the future.” A premium tier will launch this fall, allowing subscribers to bring laptops into the scent domes, further heightening the illusion of working in a coffee shop—without ever touching a cup.
