WASHINGTON, D.C. — A growing coalition of America’s office workers issued an urgent appeal Monday for the federal government to implement a real-world "Ctrl+Z" function that would allow citizens to instantly undo regrettable decisions, including but not limited to emailing the wrong client, dropping a burrito in the parking lot, or spending three years in the wrong marriage.  

The proposal, drafted by a bipartisan group of exhausted mid-level project managers, claims that the availability of a universal undo shortcut could save the U.S. economy an estimated $487 billion annually in “oops-related productivity losses.” According to the group’s 142-page report, American workers waste an average of 11 hours each week attempting to fix mistakes that could easily be reversed if someone simply pressed two keys at the same time in the sky.  

“Life is messy, and quite frankly, the human brain was not designed to remember to attach a PDF before hitting send,” said Jordan Keibler, spokesperson for Undo America, the nonprofit leading the campaign. “If digital life offers this tool for typos, why should citizens not enjoy equal protections in physical reality? Yesterday I sent my boss a meme that was absolutely intended for a group chat named ‘Idiot CEO Memes.’ Imagine the relief if I could just… hit Ctrl+Z.”  

Tech experts have allegedly been exploring a “universal reversal protocol” since at least 2016, when a pilot program successfully allowed one Indiana man to unsend a text to his ex-wife. Unfortunately, the test collapsed after researchers realized the man had also chosen to unstir his coffee, resulting in scalding liquid instantly leaping from his stomach back into a mug. Funding for further development was suspended “pending mop acquisition.”  

Local businesses have been quick to endorse the idea, claiming it will help with decisions that haunt customers. “Just last week, we had a guy order six shots of espresso at 8:30 p.m.,” said a Starbucks manager in Seattle. “With Ctrl+Z, he could have returned the beverage to us before spending the night aggressively vacuuming his apartment carpet by individual fiber.”  

Critics, however, warn of potential abuse. A report from the Heritage Policy Institute cautions that “constant undoing could destabilize society, as millions of citizens would immediately retract every haircut, tattoo, and Facebook relationship status update ever made, leading to widespread confusion and a serious overpopulation of mullets in circulation.” The report also notes that younger generations who grew up with photo filters may undergo uncontrolled cycles of infinite self-edits, disappearing permanently in twirling loops of regret and minor adjustments.  

Still, the movement appears to be gaining momentum. A petition on Change.org demanding real-world Ctrl+Z has already gathered 14 million signatures, most from people who mistyped their original names while signing and then realized, with grim resignation, that they couldn’t go back and fix it.  

White House officials confirmed the President has been briefed on the issue after he repeatedly said “schedule press conference for 2 a.m.” into his calendar by mistake. Sources close to the administration suggest the Commander-in-Chief is “very open to the possibility” of implementing an undo command, particularly if it can be applied retroactively to “that one haircut from 1987.”  

Analysts predict that if the program succeeds, popular demand may quickly shift to requests for “Select All” and “Find/Replace,” though experts admit a nationwide search for synonyms of “synergy” may cause irreparable damage to the English language.  

For now, Americans remain hopeful. As Undo America’s Keibler stated in closing remarks to reporters: “We’ve come too far as a society to keep living with consequences.”
