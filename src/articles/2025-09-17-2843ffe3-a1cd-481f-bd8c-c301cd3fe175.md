# Local Gym Launches Revolutionary "Nap-Based Fitness Program" Promising Results Without Movement  

**SPRINGFIELD, IL** — In a bold departure from traditional workouts that typically involve physical exertion, FlexPro Fitness announced Tuesday the nationwide rollout of its *SomnaFit™ Nap-Based Training Program*, a revolutionary fitness regimen that claims members can burn calories, build muscle memory, and achieve peak performance entirely while unconscious.  

According to the company, SomnaFit uses a “proprietary sleep-optimized environment” in which participants are gently placed in reclining chairs, swaddled in weighted blankets, and encouraged to drift off for fitness-enhancing fourteen-minute power naps. “Science proves the body does its most important work during rest,” said FlexPro spokesperson Jenna Michaels. “We’ve simply optimized resting until it becomes indistinguishable from exercise.”  

Early adopters report remarkable results. “I signed up two weeks ago and haven’t moved once,” explained Springfield resident Kyle Brennan. “My Apple Watch says I only got up to pee, but somehow my resting heart rate is lower, and my self-esteem has doubled.” FlexPro claims participants like Brennan are part of the initial 72% of clients who saw “life-changing results” within their first nap cycle, though when pressed for further details, the company clarified that “life-changing” included “feeling slightly calmer after dozing.”  

The SomnaFit facilities are outfitted with dim lighting, carefully curated rainstorm soundtracks, and what trainers refer to as “coaches”: low-wage interns gently reminding sleepers that they are “crushing it.” A recent company brochure describes the unique motivational strategy as “90% soothing whispers, 10% incense.”  

Medical experts are divided. Dr. Linda Castell, a sleep scientist at the University of Chicago, applauded FlexPro for “finally embracing the one part of wellness Americans consistently excel at ignoring.” Meanwhile, fitness trainer Dan Rodgers criticized the program as “basically a high-end waiting room with better pillows.” Rodgers also expressed concern about some of the advanced classes, such as *REM Cardio* and *Extreme Snoring for Core Strength.*  

Despite skepticism, memberships are skyrocketing. FlexPro charges $129 a month for the basic nap package, while premium tiers offer “Deep REM Gains,” including aromatherapy, optional cuddle partners (professionally trained in passive encouragement), and a subscription app that tracks not your steps, but the number of times per day you’ve thought about exercise before taking a nap instead.  

Local businesses are attempting to cash in on the trend. A nearby smoothie bar has already launched a sleep-compatible protein shake called “Dream Whey,” which staff assure can be consumed while unconscious via “hypothetical osmosis.” Early reviews suggest the drink has no nutritional value but “tastes like a fleeting sense of purpose.”  

Not everyone is convinced, however. “I fell asleep for an hour and woke up feeling great,” said Springfield retiree Doris Walker. “But then I realized I could have done that at home for free, which is why I now owe FlexPro $389 in cancellation penalties.”  

Industry analysts nevertheless expect SomnaFit to dominate the wellness market, noting that the program has “finally solved fitness’s biggest obstacle: requiring effort.” One recent investor projection suggested that by 2025, one in three Americans could be “accidentally exercising” merely by dozing off in public spaces.  

As FlexPro ramps up its marketing campaign, the company has already teased its next evolutionary leap in fitness technology: **telepathic crunches conducted entirely in the imagination while asleep.**
