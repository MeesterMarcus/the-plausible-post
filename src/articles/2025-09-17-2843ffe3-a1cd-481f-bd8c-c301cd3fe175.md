DUNDEE, FL—In a radical new approach to traffic control, officials in the small town of Dundee announced Tuesday that they have installed so-called “emotional speed bumps”—digital roadside displays programmed to remind drivers of their childhood disappointments—in an effort to reduce reckless driving.  

According to town spokesperson Clarisse Howell, the system flashes hyper-targeted messages such as *“Remember when your father missed your school play?”* and *“It’s been 14 days since your sister returned your call”* when drivers pass through residential zones. The technology, developed by a Miami-based startup, accesses public records, social media posts, and “vibes-based analytics” in order to deliver maximum psychological impact in real time.  

“Traditional speed bumps only slow cars mechanically. These slow people spiritually,” Howell explained at a press conference in front of a blindingly bright LED panel currently displaying, *‘Your ex was right about you.’* “When someone feels the weight of their own inner failings, they naturally ease off the gas pedal.”  

Local residents report mixed results. “I was going 45 in a 25, and then the sign just screamed, ‘Your dog preferred your brother,’” said Dundee resident Marcus Liu. “I pulled over immediately and cried for 15 minutes. Once I got back on the road, I was barely going 10 miles per hour.” By contrast, another driver said the system only fueled his anger: “It said, ‘You peaked at 19.’ So I floored it, just to prove it wrong. And then, yeah, I got a ticket.”  

Preliminary studies show the units are “87 percent more effective” at reducing speeding than ordinary signs, though researchers note that most of that effect comes from motorists pulling over to reexamine their life choices. A survey also found that 41 percent of Dundee residents now fear leaving their homes at all, concerned that the emotional speed bumps might reveal sensitive family secrets they’d rather not confront during a quick grocery run.  

Some citizens have expressed concern that the system is “too personal.” “Last week it told me, ‘Your nephew finds you embarrassing on TikTok,’” said retiree Joan McCluskey. “I don’t even know what TikTok is, but I can’t stop thinking about it.” Asked if she now drives more slowly, McCluskey replied, “No, but I definitely drink more ginger ale.”  

Officials remain optimistic. The Dundee City Council has already voted to expand the program with new “existential roundabouts” that ask drivers to consider whether life itself is circular and pointless each time they merge. Meanwhile, the police department is testing an “empathy crosswalk,” which projects holograms of kindergarteners holding puppies to force drivers to wrestle with the concept of innocence before accelerating again.  

“Some critics say manipulating the deepest recesses of the human psyche just to enforce traffic laws is unethical,” said Howell. “But others say it’s cheaper than repainting lane markers. At the end of the day, we’re saving lives—while also airing out some unresolved family trauma.”  

At press time, city engineers confirmed the next update for the system would include audio, so that cars traveling over 50 mph would be serenaded by a calm, robotic voice softly whispering: *“Your mother was always slightly disappointed in you.”*
