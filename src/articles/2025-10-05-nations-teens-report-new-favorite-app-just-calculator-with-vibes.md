WASHINGTON — In what researchers are calling an unprecedented rearrangement of adolescent attention economy, a new nationwide survey released Wednesday found that the country's teenagers have crowned their favorite smartphone app: a basic calculator "with vibes."

The app, which combines standard arithmetic functions with programmable color gradients, soft ASMR button sounds, and a "mood-adaptive UI," overtook social networks, streaming platforms, and a once-beloved photo-editing tool in a poll of 3,200 teens conducted by the National Youth Media Institute. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said the calculator "makes math feel like an atmosphere," while 54 percent said they open it purely to check the design and not to compute anything.

"It's not just for homework anymore," said Talia Ruiz, 16, of Sacramento. "I open it when I'm sad, when I'm trying to focus, or when I want to prove to someone my home screen matches my vibe. It does subtraction, but it also subtracts stress."

Developed by a three-person startup in Austin, CalcVibe launched a year ago with a minimalist pitch: same scientific functions you expect, "but with vibes." The app's free tier includes 12 preset moods — "Sunset Study," "Lo-Fi Integer," "Chaotic Neutral" — while a premium subscription unlocks Zodiac-synced gradients, an ambient click pack, and the "Focus Flux" algorithm that subtly reshuffles button spacing based on heart-rate variability data.

"Users don't just want tools; they want moods," said company co-founder Mark Evers, who declined to disclose revenue but confirmed that CalcVibe recently closed a seed round valuing the company at a reported $186 million. "We're offering a utility that respects teens as curators of experience."

Teachers and parents have expressed bewilderment. "Kids are opening calculators and taking screenshots of them during tests," said Lena Hartwell, an English teacher in Cleveland. "They're trading skins like they used to trade sneakers. I had a student ask me if 'Cosmic Mode' could be used as a citation style."

Experts say the phenomenon reflects broader shifts in digital consumption. A study from the Digital Aesthetics Lab at Midwestern State found that 72 percent of adolescents reported feeling emotionally validated when using apps that "align with their interior atmosphere," even if the apps' primary functions were unrelated to mood. "This is not about math," the paper concluded. "This is about signaling, ritual, and the domestication of anxiety."

Corporate America noticed. PhoneCo announced an update to its operating system allowing developers to register "vibe plugins," while a major social network quietly experimented with "Calculator Moments" — ephemeral posts featuring images of home screens. Regulators, too, reportedly have an eye on the space. The Federal Consumer Tech Authority confirmed it is "monitoring behavioral design" in mood-driven utility apps to determine whether they employ manipulative hooks.

CalcVibe's in-app economy has already spawned peripheral industries: enamel pins replicating popular themes, influencer "unboxing" videos of new gradient packs, and underground forums where teens trade custom sound loops. "It's basically micro-collecting for the smartphone era," said Dr. Jonah Reed, a sociologist at Evergreen College. "The calculator is now a canvas."

Not everyone is amused. Some parents have attempted to counterprogram, installing plain, gray calculator apps on household devices. "My son refused to use it," said Michael Peters, 45. "He said I couldn't 'neutralize his palette.'"

When asked whether the craze would last, teens were unmoved by predictions. "If an influencer posts about a retro flashlight app with better grain, we'll switch," said Maya Johnson, 17. At press time, screenshots of a competitor's monochrome calculator labeled "vintage interface" were already trending, confirming what industry watchers quietly suspected: in youth culture, even vibes have an expiration date.
