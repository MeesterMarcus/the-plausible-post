**SAN FRANCISCO** — MuseLess, a stealth-mode startup promising to eliminate the cognitive burden of generating original thought, announced Wednesday that it raised $200 million in a Series B round to "disrupt the concept of having ideas."

The company, which calls its product the *Idea Provision System (IPS)*, said the funding round was led by marquee venture firm FutureInverse and valued MuseLess at $1.7 billion. IPS, described as a *“curated ideation-as-a-service platform,”* uses neural nets, behavioral nudges, and a subscription model to intercept the human need to originate ideas and instead deliver prevalidated concepts on demand.

>"Our data shows most people are better served by decision-ready concepts than by the messy process of thinking," said CEO Rowan Price. "With IPS, you don’t have to have an idea anymore — just a thought approved by experts and backed by market-tested insight."

A leaked pitch deck teased features like **Auto-Justification** (instant rationale for any supplied idea), **Patent-Ready Packaging** (formats ideas to pass early-stage patent filters), and **Bandwidth Mode** (limits user deliberation to 90 seconds). MuseLess also touts enterprise integrations, including a Slack plugin that *“auto-posts a vetted take whenever a meeting lulls.”*

According to internal research from the *Institute for Cognitive Offloading*, 78 percent of knowledge workers would prefer to lease ideas rather than create them. The startup claims beta users experienced a 94 percent drop in “decision fatigue,” though 62 percent reported mild ennui and 7 percent described “transient blankness.”

FutureInverse partner Lila Strom called the concept “a massive market opportunity in removing ideation friction,” adding, *“Think of it as Uber for inspiration, minus the driver.”*

Not everyone is impressed. Cognitive scientist Dr. Amir Castillo of Stanford raised concerns about *epistemic unemployment*: “We’re not just outsourcing tasks; we’re outsourcing the muscle that recognizes a good move,” he warned.

MuseLess counters that its platform includes guardrails such as “Idea Credits” for redeeming bespoke thoughts, adjustable creativity tolerances, and weekly *nostalgia prompts* to simulate the feeling of once having had an idea. The company is reportedly in talks with several universities to license IPS for freshman orientation, where early-stage “ideation inconsistency” is a known challenge.

Local reactions were mixed. “Honestly, I’d love not to think of little things like birthday gift ideas anymore,” said Mission District barista Marina Lopez. “But I still want something to blame when a project fails.” A nearby philosophy professor, scrolling through the startup’s FAQ, murmured, “We’ve reached peak outsourcing.”

With the new funding, MuseLess plans to hire more engineers, expand enterprise marketing, and lobby for *“thinking-light”* workplace policies. Future roadmap items include **licensed default opinions for family gatherings** and an **Idea Bank** allowing companies to buy bulk thought bundles.

Asked what the company ultimately hopes to achieve, Price offered a succinct answer: “To make having ideas optional.” He added that the platform’s premium tier will include one fully original, non-licensed thought every decade.
