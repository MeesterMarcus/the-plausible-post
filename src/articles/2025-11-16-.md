NATIONAL — In a move company executives described as "bringing accountability to the chassis of commerce," national supermarket chain HarvestMart on Monday began assigning every shopper a real-time "CartScore," a numeric rating generated by sensors in shopping carts that HarvestMart says will reward efficient customers and help streamline the in-store experience.

The CartScore algorithm, rolled out to 1,200 stores this week and slated for nationwide implementation by the end of the quarter, evaluates shoppers on 37 variables HarvestMart lists on its website. Metrics include average aisle speed, time spent reading ingredient labels, impulse-stop ratio, coupon redemption efficiency, and "emotional loitering," defined in the white paper as any pause exceeding 18.3 seconds while staring at the artisanal jam aisle.

"Our customers told us they want faster trips, more reliable product placement, and fewer encounters with strangers who seem uncertain about going to the dairy," said HarvestMart Chief Experience Officer Linda Crenshaw at a press event, where a shopping cart demonstrably blinked an amber score of 68. "CartScore gives every shopper clear, actionable feedback. If you score well, you'll be routed to express lanes, personalized coupons, and our new 'Green Cart' parking. If you score poorly, we gently suggest improvements."

HarvestMart's internal report, made public Monday, claims CartScore reduced average in-store time by 22 percent during pilot tests, while increasing per-trip spend by 11 percent. "We saw the most dramatic gains among households with two or more primary decision-makers," the report reads. "Single-subject shoppers showed the least improvement but the highest propensity to train their children in aisle navigation."

The rollout has already produced what sociologists and local shoppers described as predictable social adjustments. In suburban Springfield, a weekly power-shopping boot camp now meets every Saturday at 7 a.m. in the HarvestMart parking lot, where self-appointed "Cart Coaches" offer clinics on five-point turns, strategic coupon stacking, and etiquette for passing slower carts.

"It used to be a leisurely Sunday," said attendee Mark Delaney, holding a laminated cheat sheet with suggested trajectories through produce and cleaning supplies. "Now my kids do 15-minute simulations in the driveway. Their scores went from the low 40s to near perfect in three weeks. We even got a free muffin."

Privacy advocates and behavioral economists warned the system could exacerbate inequality and normalize surveillance. "This isn't about efficiency; it's about monetizing compliance," said Dr. Ayesha Raman of the Center for Consumer Autonomy. "CartScore effectively privatizes norms of public behavior and ties them to tangible benefits like lane assignment and promotional visibility. Our study estimates people with scores below 50 were 12 percent less likely to receive targeted discounts during the pilot."

HarvestMart acknowledged concerns but defended the program, saying low scorers will still be welcomed. "CartScore is optional," said Crenshaw. "You can opt out at any time by placing a sticker on your cart that says 'Reflective Shopper — Low Score, High Intent.' Those customers will be gently assisted by our newly trained 'Browsing Ambassadors.'"

Corporate product details include a premium subscription, HarvestMart+ Cart, which offers a "score buffer" allowing three leisurely pauses per trip without penalty, and a "nostalgia mode" for shoppers who wish to preserve pre-optimization wandering for $4.99 a month.

Local pastors reported their congregations are adapting as well — at St. Bartholomew's, the youth group now hosts timed grocery relay races as a fundraiser. "We want to teach stewardship," said Pastor Jim O'Rourke. "But mostly we want to win the $50 gift card."

When asked whether CartScore might ever be used to determine human worth, a HarvestMart spokesman presented a smiling barcode that scanned as 82 and said, "We consider the program a public service."
