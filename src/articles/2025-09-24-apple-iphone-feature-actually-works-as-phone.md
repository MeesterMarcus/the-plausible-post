**CUPERTINO, CA**—In a move hailed by industry analysts as “boldly retro,” Apple announced Wednesday that its upcoming iPhone model will feature a groundbreaking new function: the ability to operate as an actual telephone.  

“For the first time in nearly two decades, iPhone users will be able to press a button, dial a number, and speak to another human being in real time,” said Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak during a sleek, hour-long keynote presentation at Apple Park. “No FaceTime, no emoji reactions, no awkward frozen screens—just the raw, analog thrill of one person’s voice traveling across a wireless network and being heard on the other end. We think this changes everything.”  

The new feature, dubbed **iPhone Call™**, is being described by Apple executives as the next logical step in the smartphone’s evolution. While past models emphasized improved cameras, larger screens, and increasingly lifelike Memojis, critics had pointed out that most iPhones had not been capable of reliably completing a phone call since roughly 2007. According to Apple, the new model will correct this oversight by introducing “call connectivity” that allows users to experience crisp, uninterrupted conversations lasting up to several minutes at a time.  

“Until now, asking an iPhone to make a phone call was like asking a Roomba to do your taxes,” said industry analyst Elena Hu. “It would half-try, sputter for a bit, and then collapse under the weight of its own ambition. Apple is finally acknowledging what competitors like Nokia cracked back in the late ’90s: phones can, in fact, function as phones.”  

At the event, attendees were treated to a live demonstration in which an Apple engineer dialed an actual telephone number onstage. The audience gasped as the call not only connected, but also transmitted a full “hello” and “can you hear me?” without dropping. Those who witnessed the moment described it as “spiritually moving” and “better than the first iPod unveiling.”  

Apple insists that iPhone Call™ relies on “proprietary vocal signal technology” that harnesses the device’s microphone, speaker, and something called “car-ry-er networks,” a term that drew curious murmurs from the crowd. Early beta testers reported that the feature allows them to speak directly to relatives, doctors, and even pizza delivery shops—all without typing, swiping, or updating iOS.  

Customers, however, are split. While some herald the development as “a miracle,” others question whether society is ready to return to the old-fashioned intimacy of voice conversations. “I don’t want to hear my boss’s voice. I just want a Slack notification I can ignore,” said Brooklyn resident Trevor Klein, 29, who plans to disable the feature upon purchase.  

In typical Apple fashion, the company is pricing the innovation accordingly. The new iPhone 16 will retail for $1,499, with the iPhone Call™ functionality available only through a $29.99 monthly “Speech Plan” subscription. Apple also revealed a $199 accessory, the iCall Pro Dock, which allows users to hold the iPhone up to their ear without it slipping.  

Critics note that Android phones already include the ability to make phone calls for free, but Apple executives dismissed the comparison. “Ours will be better,” Joswiak insisted. “You’ll have to try it to understand.”  

The keynote concluded with Apple CEO Tim Cook summarizing the announcement in simple, profound terms: “We believe talking to other people is the future.”  

At press time, Apple confirmed that the following year’s model will allow users to hang up.
