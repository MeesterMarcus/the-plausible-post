In a landmark decision for the pharmaceutical industry, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has officially approved the first-ever “Placebo Plus” pill, designed specifically for patients who don’t really need medication but would feel weird leaving the doctor’s office empty-handed.  

According to FDA officials, Placebo Plus is chemically identical to a sugar pill but has been improved with "suggestively medical packaging" and an “optional faint chalky taste” that provides what researchers call a “therapeutic sense of direction.”  

“Clinical trials show that up to 72 percent of patients reported feeling ‘better’ simply because they had something rectangular to place in their weekly pill organizer,” said Dr. Lynette Harrington, lead researcher for the approval process. “By giving people a small inert object to swallow twice daily, we can replicate many of the psychological benefits of actual medicine without, frankly, all that pesky science.”  

Doctors across the country are already praising the approval, noting the widespread applicability in their practices. “It’s incredible for patients who walk in with nothing objectively wrong but still request something with a Latin name,” said Dr. Jonah Patel of the Cleveland Clinic. “Finally, I can prescribe them Placebo Plus and get home in time for dinner.”  

The manufacturer, LifePill Inc., emphasized that Placebo Plus isn’t just a blank sugar pill, but a “next-generation wellness experience.” Each capsule is embossed with a vaguely reassuring logo, and packaging will feature words like “balanced,” “trusted,” and “advanced” in calming shades of blue and green. A “Placebo Plus Premium” version, available for an additional $49.99 per month, comes with a placebo effect enhanced by a mild sparkle coating in case a patient “needs to really feel like something’s happening.”  

“This is about innovation,” said LifePill CEO Mark Benson. “For centuries, patients have had to settle for the same old placebos, usually administered in bland white tablets. Our proprietary technology ensures a more emotionally resonant sense of fake healing.” Benson further noted that Placebo Plus will be marketed directly to consumers during prime-time television with commercials showing smiling people jogging, surrounded by a golden meadow that is in no way related to the pill’s function.  

Some critics argue that the pill could be abused. “There’s always the risk of overprescribing Placebo Plus,” said Harvard bioethicist Charlotte Weems. “For instance, pharmacists last week reported people requesting refills after just three days because they liked the attention they got from holding a prescription bag.”  

Still, public demand has already outpaced supply. Pharmacies nationwide reported crowds lining up before dawn, many of them insisting the mere act of scribbling their names on the prescription pad “was already making them feel much, much better.”  

At press time, LifePill confirmed it is already developing “Placebo Plus Pro,” a version that comes with a placebo app for smartphones, allowing patients to log imaginary side effects and track their recovery from absolutely nothing in real time.
