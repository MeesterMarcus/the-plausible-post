Martha Lane, 78, who has quietly been perfecting her buttery, flake-apart biscuits for five decades, became an unlikely front-row critic of generative AI this week after a popular recipe app published a "regional biscuit technique" that Lane insists is a very specific, very hers.

"They put my soul in a JSON file and called it 'Southern-style Base,'" Lane said at a packed community center on Saturday, waving a spatula like a placard. "You can't just scrape fifty years of love and call it an algorithmic suggestion."

Lane's response has been both practical and performative: she composed a short manifesto — equal parts cooking notes and civic poetry — urging "biscuit sovereignty," then organized a hands-on workshop titled "How to Tell if a Biscuit Was Made by a Person." The event included side-by-side tastings where attendees compared store-bought biscuits, an app-generated "classic" produced by copying public recipes, and Lane's own warm batch.

The workshop's curriculum leaned surprisingly modern. Volunteers taught a simple three-step test for "authenticity": smell, texture, and an interview with the cook. Attendees were instructed to ask whether the maker had ever burned a tray, cried into a batter, or told a story while stirring — non-algorithmic behaviors that, according to Lane, are the secret ingredients.

Local tech commentator Ravi Nair, who stopped by the workshop expecting satire and left with crumbs on his sleeve, offered a cautious take: "There's a real conversation here about attribution and cultural respect. But also, the biscuits are excellent and might give the AI models something to aspire to."

Lane's manifesto proposes a modest policy ask: that companies labeling generated recipes should include a "made-by" field — human, hybrid, or synthetic — and that restaurants receiving a "human-authenticated" tag be eligible for a local heritage grant. "If you want to move into the meat-and-potatoes of copyright, do it," she told reporters. "But until then, at least ask whose grandma taught them."

The story has already caught flame online, with hobbyist cooks and journalists amplifying Lane's call. A hashtag, #BiscuitSovereignty, trended briefly on Saturday evening, used alternately to post pictures of flaky pastries and to roast a robotics startup that once tried to patent a "self-stirring spoon."

Lane says she doesn't hate technology; she just doesn't want it to pretend to taste. "I'll show them what a human biscuit is," she said, offering a fresh one to a skeptical journalist. "You can't replicate memory in a mixer." The journalist accepted the biscuit, then promptly forgot his AI talking points.
