In a highly unexpected corporate shake-up, McDonald’s announced that customers will now have to *prove they deserve fries* before ordering them. Executives called the requirement “a natural evolution in customer engagement,” insisting fries should be treated as a reward, not a given.  

Beginning next week, anyone asking for fries will be evaluated on their worthiness. This could involve recounting good deeds, enduring life’s minor inconveniences with grace, or at least answering *“Did you recycle today?”* without hesitation. “Our fries are special,” said Chief Innovation Officer Derek Hull. “We won’t let people squander them without demonstrating emotional readiness.”  

According to the company’s new manuals, acceptable qualifications for fry access include:  
- Having a decent attitude while stuck behind a slow-moving minivan  
- Demonstrating patience at the airport security line  
- Completing a small but earnest day of work  

Those who fail the screening will instead receive a celery stick and a motivational pamphlet titled *Steps Toward Future Fry Eligibility.*  

Customer responses have been split. Some see the system as a chance for personal accountability, while others bristle at the idea of a fast-food therapy session before getting a medium order. “I’m not doing a TED Talk for potatoes,” said one frustrated diner.  

To streamline compliance, McDonald’s is piloting a **digital Fry Score™ app**, which analyzes phone usage, commute behavior, and even how often drivers let others merge. Participation is “voluntary,” but those who opt out must endure in-person fry interviews lasting up to 10 minutes.  

Market analysts say restricting fries may increase consumer desire through scarcity. “It elevates fries into the same moral category as voting, donating blood, or mastering parallel parking,” explained one expert.  

One loophole remains: McDonald’s confirmed that no proof of merit will ever be required for Filet-O-Fish purchases—an exemption attributed to the understanding that “nobody truly deserves one of those.”
