In a stunning display of optimism paired with self-sabotage, local man Mark Henderson told neighbors Monday that he will "definitely" begin his diet tomorrow â€” though he was seen placing an extra-large pepperoni pizza in his cart at the store.

"Tomorrow is the day," Henderson said, putting the pizza in the cart. "Just need to finish this season of my show first."

Friends say they believe him, but not right now.
