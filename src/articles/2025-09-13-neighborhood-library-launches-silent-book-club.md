After the city council's recent noise ordinance passed, the downtown library announced a community initiative designed to comply with the new rules and improve concentration: a weekly "Silent Book Club."

Organizers insist the club is not a performance and will feature no discussion during meetings. Participants are welcome to bring annotations, but must whisper them into a private notebook. "We wanted a social reading experience without the social," said the head librarian.

The program has already drawn a modest crowd of avid readers and people who want to appear intellectual while avoiding conversation. The library plans to stream soft ambient page-turning sounds just outside the door for anyone curious.
